# Multi-Level-Identity-Authentication-Framework

A Multi-Level Identity authentication system is proposed which determines if the person is who they say they are. Authentication relies on additional data that is difficult to produce, except by that specific person. The problem is solved using a three-level framework, which performs password authentication, signature verification and then cross comparing the real time face to ID photo. In order to achieve this, we employ image analysis and computer vision techniques.

Signature Recognition and Validation is the process of authenticating the personâ€™s identity by checking his signature against samples which are previously collected. Facial comparison is typically used where a trusted source image of the user is available to compare a real-time image against. The trusted source picture is usually extracted from an authenticated identity document such as a passport.
